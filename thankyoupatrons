    Thank you for joining us on Patreon! Our goal is to make open-source math and science lessons that are freely available to everyone. We couldn't do this without your support! In gratitude, we've put together a page of fun extras just for you.
  </p>

    We hope you
    Click here to see the patron-only goodies we've gathered. There are escape rooms, science valentines, a collection of behind-the-scenes videos, and - if you are new to Patreon - we have a video introduction that breaks it all down.
