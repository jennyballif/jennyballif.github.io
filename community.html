  <h3>Schedule (or win) a Science Mom visit to your school!</h3>
  <p>If you would like to schedule a Science Mom visit for your school or event, use the contact form below or email jenny@science.mom to learn more about availability. The rate for a full day elementary school visit is $496 and includes as many individual classroom visits and/or assemblies as time will allow. Science Mom provides NGSS-aligned coloring pages and worksheets for each teacher, which can be used as an assessment or follow-up activity to the science demonstration. </p>
    
  <p> Each month of the school year (except December) Science Mom donates two visits to a public elementary school in Clark County, Nevada. If you would like to enter your school for a free visit, simply <a href="https://forms.gle/i7bhGtNqMJfejE83A" target=_blank>fill out this form</a>. If you would like to support this effort and help us reach more schools, visit <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ScienceMom" target="_blank">www.patreon.com/sciencemom</a> to become a patron. The winning schools are typically announced on the first day of each month. If your school is not selected, you can enter the drawing again in subsequent months.</p>
