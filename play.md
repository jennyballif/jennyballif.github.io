  <p>Have you ever wondered why water expands when it freezes? Is black ink really black? How can you make the mentos and coke eruption even bigger? These are the types of questions Science Mom investigates.</p>

  <p>The world needs more curiosity, wonder, and investigative thinking—and that’s just what my videos and Science Mom Guides aim to encourage. They're all free! Download the guides and make as many copies as you like. Share them with your kids, parents, classroom, teachers, and friends.</p>
