  Each year I teach hundreds of science lessons as a volunteer in public school classrooms. I hope you’ll join me and inspire the next generation to have a passion for science. Your sponsorship is a valuable way to promote STEM education and literacy, and has a tangible impact to thousands of elementary age students here in Nevada.

<h4>  HOW IT STARTED </h4>
<p>
  	In 2013 I volunteered to teach a 15 minute science demonstration each week in my son’s first grade class. I’ve always loved science, and I am what most people would consider a “real” scientist, having a master’s degree in Plant Science with an emphasis in Molecular Biology. Before I began doing science demonstrations, the kids in that first grade class knew me as “Andrew’s Mom.” When I started bringing in science each week, the kids began to call me “Science Mom.” The name stuck and my job grew. Within a year I was visiting 10 classrooms a week, and now I have a YouTube channel (called Science Mom) and visit schools all over the Las Vegas valley.

  Science Mom makes highly complex topics, such as the states of matter, forces, and chemical changes, understandable even to first graders! The enhanced knowledge they walk away with, combined with the realization that science can be so much fun…is priceless!

Science mom is amazing! My students and I have loved every lesson. She always includes high interest demonstrations that reinforce that day’s concepts and vocabulary. Watch out Bill Nye!
