  <h2> Sign up for a Meet and Greet before the Earth Science Course.</H2> 
  <p>We hope you’ll join us <strong>for one</strong> of our small group meetups! This is a chance for you to get to know a few of your classmates and chat with us face to face. Each meetup will be limited to 12 participants. We’re going to share two of our favorite books we’ve read recently, and we’d love to have you to bring something to share too! It can be a favorite book or hobby, your family pet, or a question for us. </p>
  
<p> The times below should appear in your own time zone. Just select the timeslot that works best for you to reserve your spot. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to email us at jenny@science.mom. We’re so excited for our Earth Science class! </p>
