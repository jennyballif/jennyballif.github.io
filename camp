          July 6-10, 2020

          Join Science Mom & Math Dad for a week of classes and activities, all about animals. Each day includes a 2-hour livestream with fascinating facts and fun activities. While the target age is 7-12 years old, camp is open to all ages.
          Campers can join live each day at 1:00 PM Eastern or watch the replay afterward. ​​​

          **Registration has two-parts. After you pay, you will be redirected to enter the email address where you would like to receive announcements about camp. If you have any questions, contact us at jenny@science.mom**

          Explore the animal kingdom.
           ○​​​​​​​ Monday: Scorpions, Spiders, and Bugs - Oh my!
           ○ Tuesday: Feathered Friends
           ○ Wednesday: Wild world of Reptiles
           ○ Thursday: Life Underwater, a lesson on Amphibians and Fish
          ​​​​​​​ ○ Friday: Mammals and Marsupials

          Dive deep into biology. Each day we explore the diversity and incredible survival skills these animals have developed.

          Daily crafts and art lessons. Our craft projects are easy to do and tons of fun — and you'll receive a complete supply list before we begin. 

          Naturalist-in-training stickers. Each day includes a naturalist challenge designed to encourage a love for and appreciation of nature. If you are unable to venture out, there are indoor variations. Complete them all to earn your stickers!

          Camp scrapbook. Each camper receives a print friendly PDF document that contains all the activities, games, and more. Look forward to your camper writing home about their learning adventures! 

          Cost for a whole week of camp: $25 
          Families with multiple kids only need to pay once!
