  <p>I'm Jenny Ballif, more commonly known as Science Mom, creator of educational videos and Science Mom Guides--pocket sized coloring books that you can fold from a single piece of paper. </p>

<p>I hope you'll take a few minutes to watch my videos, download the guides, and explore engaging science activities. And if you'd like to join me in my mission to bring the world more curiosity, wonder, and investigative thinking, check out my Patreon page! You can meet some of my wonderful patrons (cartoon versions of them) in the Periodic Table of Patrons below. Hover over the image below to zoom in.</p>
