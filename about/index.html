  <p>We make the kind of curriculum we wanted for our own kids: clear explanations, thoughtful projects, and lessons that build real understanding without busywork. We do almost everything ourselves so our courses stay personal, practical, and carefully designed.</p>

    <summary>Who we are</summary>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>Science Mom has worked as a molecular biologist and a wildland firefighter, and at several jobs that land in between wearing a lab coat and wielding a chainsaw. She has a bachelor's degree in crop science and a master's degree in plant science, both from Utah State University. In 2013, she volunteered to bring weekly science experiments to her son's second grade class and her name changed from "Andrew's Mom" to "Science Mom." She's been sharing science with kids ever since.</p>

      <p>Math dad grew up on a dairy farm in Southern Idaho. He has a PhD in mathematics from Penn State University and loves teaching all types of math, from arithmetic to advanced topics. In 2020, he joined Science Mom to teach 52 free math and science lessons on YouTube. During these lessons, he gained a bit of a cult-following by singing a song no one knew the words to. He's been working with Science Mom making videos (and singing songs) ever since./<p>

      <p>Science mom and Math Dad live in Alaska with their three kids and two very adorable dogs.</p>

    <summary>How our courses work</summary>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>Families use Science Mom in a few different ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Join live lessons</strong> for interaction and accountability</li>
        <li><strong>Watch replays</strong> on your own schedule</li>
        <li><strong>Go self-paced</strong>, using the lessons as a structured curriculum</li>
      </ul>

    <summary>What to expect from our teaching style</summary>
    <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>You'll see a few consistent themes across everything we make:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clarity first.</strong> We explain ideas in plain language and build concepts step-by-step.</li>
        <li><strong>Real learning, not fluff.</strong> We focus on the big ideas and the skills that matter—observing, modeling, reasoning, and making connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-on whenever it helps.</strong> We use experiments and projects to turn abstract concepts into something students can see and test.</li>
        <li><strong>Friendly and encouraging.</strong> We take learning seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. We aim for a calm, welcoming tone where kids feel safe asking questions.</li>
