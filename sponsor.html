  Science Mom makes highly complex topics, such as the states of matter, forces, and chemical changes, understandable even to first graders! The enhanced knowledge they walk away with, combined with the realization that science can be so much fun…is priceless!

Science Mom Activity Guides have comics, coloring pages, and engaging explanations of basic principles of chemistry and physics. Ideal for students age 7 to 12, the books are a fantastic tie-in to several of the Science Mom in-class presentations. By themselves, the books are an engaging and positive STEM resource, but when paired with a Science Mom visit? Even better.


<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">  How it Started </h4>
  <p>
  	In 2013 I volunteered to teach a 15 minute science demonstration each week in my son’s first grade class. I’ve always loved science, and I am what most people would consider a “real” scientist, having a master’s degree in Plant Science with an emphasis in Molecular Biology. Before I began doing science demonstrations, the kids in that first grade class knew me as “Andrew’s Mom.” When I started bringing in science each week, the kids began to call me “Science Mom.” The name stuck and my job grew. Within a year I was visiting 10 classrooms a week, and now I have a YouTube channel (called Science Mom) and visit schools all over the Las Vegas valley.
