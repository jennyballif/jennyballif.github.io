  Each year I teach hundreds of science lessons as a volunteer in public school classrooms. I hope you’ll join me and inspire the next generation to have a passion for science. Your sponsorship is a valuable way to promote STEM education and literacy, and has a tangible impact to thousands of elementary age students here in Nevada.

<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;">  How it Started </h4>
<p>
  	In 2013 I volunteered to teach a 15 minute science demonstration each week in my son’s first grade class. I’ve always loved science, and I am what most people would consider a “real” scientist, having a master’s degree in Plant Science with an emphasis in Molecular Biology. Before I began doing science demonstrations, the kids in that first grade class knew me as “Andrew’s Mom.” When I started bringing in science each week, the kids began to call me “Science Mom.” The name stuck and my job grew. Within a year I was visiting 10 classrooms a week, and now I have a YouTube channel (called Science Mom) and visit schools all over the Las Vegas valley.

  Science Mom makes highly complex topics, such as the states of matter, forces, and chemical changes, understandable even to first graders! The enhanced knowledge they walk away with, combined with the realization that science can be so much fun…is priceless!

Science mom is amazing! My students and I have loved every lesson. She always includes high interest demonstrations that reinforce that day’s concepts and vocabulary. Watch out Bill Nye!

<h4 style="margin-top: 1em;"> The Books </h4>

Science Mom Activity Guides have comics, coloring pages, and engaging explanations of basic principles of chemistry and physics. Ideal for students age 7 to 12, the books are a fantastic tie-in to several of the Science Mom in-class presentations. By themselves, the books are an engaging and positive STEM resource, but when paired with a Science Mom visit? Even better.

Once you select your sponsorship option, you can choose whether the sponsorship is anonymous or public. If public, please fill out your social media handles and a mailing address for a thank you card. Also indicate whether you would like your name or company logo listed on the Science Mom website. On the week of the school visit, Science mom will post a picture to twitter, instagram, and facebook thanking you for your support. You will also receive a fantastic thank you card in the mail. If you wish to be a sponsor but find a donation through PayPal to be inconvenient, you may also purchase books from Amazon or another book seller. Note: the books are $5 each when purchased for students through my website, and $6.99 through Amazon and other retail outlets. Please contact me at jenballif@gmail.com if you have any questions.

What your Sponsorship Brings to the Community</h4>

<ul>
<li>An engaging 30 minute Science Mom lesson, taught in a CCSD classroom.</li>
<li>
Each child in the class gets to take home their own copy of a science activity book after the visit, which greatly deepens the learning experience and makes a lot of kids incredibly happy.	</li>
<li>
Financial support of Science Mom, which means more educational YouTube videos, worksheets and handouts, and more books.
</li>
</ul>
