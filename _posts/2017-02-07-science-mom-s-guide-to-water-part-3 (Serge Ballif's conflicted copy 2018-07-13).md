title: 'Science Mom''s Guide to Water, Part 3'
description: >-
  Water doesn't just move downhill, it can move uphill too because of capillary
  action. In this investigation we explore siphons, the strangeness of small
  spaces, and more.
headline: >-
  Gravity isn't the only force that makes water move. In small spaces, capillary
  action can take water any direction. We explore both of these aspects with
  papertowels and siphons.

## Science Mom's Guide to Water, Part 3

Capillary action allows water to flow uphill, against the flow of gravity. It takes effect in small spaces and around things that water is attracted to. But water is attracted to a lot of things: plants, rocks, glass, plastic, most cloths and plenty of other materials too. This ability of water to move through small spaces has big effects in biology and geology, and it allows us to do some great science activities too.

To learn more about capillary action and adhesion, watch Science Mom's Guide to Water, part 3:

You can preview the accompanying guide by scrolling through the pages in the viewer below. To print your own copy, just select your preferred size of paper: 8½ &times; 11, 11 &times; 17, A3 or A4. __Don’t forget to print “Actual size.” Do not print “Fit to page” or the book won’t come out right.__ To fold the book, either print the two-page document double sided and follow the instructions on the back, or follow the instructions in this video: [How to Fold A Book from One Piece of Paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0sS59oMBe0&t=3s).

And join us next time for Science Mom’s Guide to Water, Part 4 [coming March, 2017], where we investigate why **water expands when frozen**.
