# Science Mom''s Guide to Water, Part 7

It's finally here! The concluding installment in the water series, a look at evaporative cooling, changes of state, and how water has an impressively high specific heat capacity:

Out of all the little cartoons I made for various properties of water (which were explored in the first six videos), High Specific Heat is my favorite.

When I first started my YouTube channel, I had an outline of a dozen videos I wanted to make. I'd planned to have 4 to 7 science experiments in each video and group them by topic. There was the series about water, with seven videos. There was a unit on eggs, milk, hydrogen peroxide, various aspects of physics... you get the idea.

But it didn't take too many videos for me to realize that this wasn't the ideal approach. Partly because the scope made each video such a big project (120 plus hours of work) that I procrastinated getting started on them, partly because it was challenging to fit the material within a 15 minute video timeframe, and partly because grouping experiments by subject like this left out quite a few gems that stood more or less on their own. So going forward, "Science Guides" like this are going to be the exception rather than the norm. I plan to have weekly science experiment videos that tackle a single experiment (rather than five of them). So watch for those.
