A big thank you and shoutout to our Taekwondo studio for supporting Science Mom! We started Taekwondo two years ago, and FamilyATA really is the perfect name for this organization. Not only because we signed up as an entire family, parents and kids kicking together, but because the community at our studio is like an extended family.

If you're in the Las Vegas area, head over to the [FamilyATA website](https://www.familyatanv.com/) to check out their schedule. They just opened a third location so you have 3 excellent options to choose from!

This card is drawn in honor of Mr. Pyne, the head instructor at our studio. In addition to having one of the best names on the Table of Patrons,he's a fellow fan of comics and all things nerd culture, so I couldn't resist adding in a little Goku. If you're wondering "What's that thing floating above his hand?" it's a massively powerful spirit bomb--a reference to Dragon Ball Z.
