You can take the Hawaiian away from Hawaii, but you can't take Hawaii out of the Hawaiian. The person this element is named for shines with island hospitality and caring. And she's also one of the strongest people I know.  

Intelligent, resiliant, compassionate--and a genius botanist who can identify trees like you wouldn't believe--these are the traits that define Noelanium.

Welcome to the table!
