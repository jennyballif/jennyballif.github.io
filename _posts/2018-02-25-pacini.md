Element 54 on the Periodic Table of Elements is Xenon, a noble gas used to light up darkness. Our corresponding place on the Periodic Table of Patrons is for Toni Pacini, a good friend of mine and an _amazing_ storyteller. Her captivating voice, incredible energy, and history of perserverance are inspiring.

Toni has written a memoir, which you can check out [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G7UZH86/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). It's the story of "A girl raised-up like an invasive weed in an Alabama cotton mill village where illiteracy, bigotry, religious fanaticism, and abuse were as commonplace as fried chicken on Sunday." _Note: this story isn't one for kids._

In addition to her memoir, Toni also writes fantastic short stories in a Southern Gothic style, runs a dynamic writers group, and pretty-much saves my bacon every week when it comes to organizing the [Las Vegas Writers Conference](http://hendersonwritersgroup.com/las-vegas-writers-conference/). She's definitely a source of light and inspiration for everyone who knows her. Once again, welcome to the table Pacini!
