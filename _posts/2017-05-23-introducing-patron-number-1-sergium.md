## Sergium

{% include image.html url="https://raw.github.com/jennyballif/jennyballif.github.io/master/images/Patron/Sergium.jpeg" description="Serge teaching math." maxwidth="600px" %}

The element Sergium is named in honor of Serge Ballif. He is both my number one patron and my other half (Math Dad!). Other nicknames include "hairy armed assistant," because you can see his arm and hand helping in a few videos (SMG1 and What color is blood REALLY?). 

For this post we did a short interview:

**Science Mom: Can you tell me a little bit about the equation in your patron card?**

Math Dad: It's the first formula I ever published--I wrote up a short filler article when I was an undergraduate student at Utah State University, and it got published in American Mathematical Monthly. 

**Science Mom: Which was super exciting. I remember cheering when we found out you were going to be in the Monthly. Explain why this equation is so neat.**

Math Dad: There are infinitely many numbers being added together, but in one sum the individual terms are squared. Yet both sums are equal. I'll rewrite it for you to make it more clear.

![Two infinite geometric series with the same sum. The second series just squares the terms of the first series.](http://mathurl.com/le5en5d.png)

**Science Mom: That is really cool.  What kind of mathematician are you?**

Math Dad: I'm an algebraist/combinatorist. 

**Science Mom: How would you explain that to a first grader?**

Math Dad: I work with cool number systems and use neat counting techniques to solve problems.

**Science Mom: If you could have lunch with any scientist, dead or living, who would you meet with, and why?**

Math Dad: Hmm. That's a tough one. Paul Erdős, maybe? He was a character, and a real legend in mathematics. He was something of a jack of all trades, and he was absolutely brilliant in combinatorics. He spent his whole life traveling the world from university to university, living out of his suitcase while collaborating with other mathematicians.

**Science Mom: Isn't he the one who couldn't cut his own grapefruit?**

Math Dad (laughing) Yep. He's the one.

**Science Mom: And he referred to children as epsilons - the greek letter that mathematicians use for small quantities?**

Math Dad: That's him. Lunch with Erdős would be amazing.

**Science Mom: And funny.**

Math Dad: Definitely.
