In the Periodic Table of Elements, number 94 is Plutonium. It was unknown and latent for millenia, and almost as soon as we discovered it, this powerful element changed the course of human history.

There's a parallel in my mind between Plutonium and Aprilium, but I'll leave the mystery up to you. Is it the power of the writen word? The potential of undiscovered truths to turn the world around? Will this author's ideas someday be a key part of our human conversation? You'll hae to wait and see...

Oh, and lastly, the text in this patron card references one of my favorite quotes, by Groucho Marx:

"Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read."
