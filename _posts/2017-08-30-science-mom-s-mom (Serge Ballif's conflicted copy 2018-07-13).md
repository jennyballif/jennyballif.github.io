I love plants, and when we go hiking I'm often stopping to snap pictures and exclaiming in delight over seeing a certain species in bloom, or discovering a rare variety of tree or an unusual looking seed pod. And nine times out of ten, when I see something beautiful in nature, my first thought is "I'd like to show my mom."

And I know she does the same thing, because she'll often tell me "I saw this, and thought of you," or send me pictures of plants.

It's really nice to have someone you can share pictures of flowers with, or tell about the BIGGEST sagebrush you saw EVER.

Thank you, mom. For being a Science Mom Patron, and for teaching me how to stop and see the beauty and wonder in the natural world.
