Hoovium is named in honor of a fantastic teacher who brings a great energy and enthusiasm to her classroom. If you think Ms. Frizzle's kids in _The Magic School Bus_ have things good when it comes to learning, then you haven't spent time in Mrs. Hoover's class. ;)

Thanks for supporting Science Mom!
