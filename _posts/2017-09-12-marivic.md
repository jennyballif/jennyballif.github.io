Not long after starting my channel, I realized that I needed a logo. My first attempt (pictured below) wasn't entirely horrible, but it wasn't that great either.

Three months and about twenty drafts later, I ended up with a better version. But still, I kept looking at my logo thinking, "There's got to be _something_ better than this."

Then one night at our Taekwondo studio, I got talking with my friend Vicki, who is a graphic designer and fellow member of the "let's kick each other and call it fun" club. 

She told me she does a little freelance design work from time to time and asked if I'd like help with the Science Mom Logo. She sent me a few sketches, and I immediately had the dilemma of "They're all fantastic, how do we choose?" We went with the version you see below, and--if any of ya'll are looking for a graphic artist, I can't recommend her highly enough.

Thanks again, and welcome to the Table!
