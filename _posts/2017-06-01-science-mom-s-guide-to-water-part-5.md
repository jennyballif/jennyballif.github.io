Water is so good at dissolving things, that it's earned the label of "Universal Solvent." But one thing water _doesn't_ dissolve is oil. In Science Mom's Guide to Water, Part 5, we explore why oil and water don't mix with four investigations: Ocean in a bottle, Lava lamp, Oil lamp, and a grease fire explosion.
