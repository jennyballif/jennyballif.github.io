description: >-
  How can 2 tablespoons of water make a fireball? Find the answer to that
  question, and more, in Part 5 of the water series.

  Water is known as the "universal solvent," but there's one thing it does not
  dissolve: oil. In this installment we explore some of the amazing things you
  can do with these two very different liquids.

Water is so good at dissolving things, that it's earned the label of "Universal Solvent." But one thing water _doesn't_ dissolve is oil. In Science Mom's Guide to Water, Part 5, we explore why oil and water don't mix with four investigations: Ocean in a bottle, Lava lamp, Oil lamp, and a grease fire explosion.
