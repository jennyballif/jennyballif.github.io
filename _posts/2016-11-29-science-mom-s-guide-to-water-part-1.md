title: 'Science Mom''s Guide to Water, Part 1'

Water is so abundant, we often take for granted how remarkable and unusual it is. Water is the __only substance__ on our planet that can exist naturally in all three states of matter: as a solid, a liquid, and a gas.

Gaseous water, or water vapor, is invisible. There's always some of it in the air around us and we call it ****humidity****. The more water vapor in the air, the more humid it is.
The only other things on earth that come close to existing in all three states of matter are mercury, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. And while all three states of matter are __possible__ with each of these, they don’t occur __naturally__. Water, on the other hand, it’s everywhere. Just look at this view of our world:

Oceans cover most of the earth’s surface, and so does another layer of water: clouds. At any given moment between 60 to 70% of the planet is under cloud cover. But as impressive as those facts are, those aren’t the only unique things about water. Water has seven other incredible properties:

Not only are these attributes of water essential for life on earth—they’re the key to a lot of fun investigations and science experiments. So join me for SCIENCE MOM’S GUIDE TO WATER, where we learn about the incredible chemistry of water through hands-on activities. 

In our first video and guide we use three fun activities to investigate ****cohesion****—the ability of water molecules to stick to each other.

You can preview the accompanying guide here by scrolling through the pages shown below. If you want to print your own copy, just select your preferred size of paper and download the pdf: (A3 [link] or A4 [link], 11 x 17[link] or 8½ x 11[link]). Don’t forget to print “Actual size.” Do not print “Fit to page” or the book won’t come out right. For instructions on folding check out my How to make a 14 page book from one piece of paper video.

Join us next time for Science Mom’s Guide to Water, Part 2[link], where we’ll investigate surface tension. And if you’re interested in learning more about water, check out these other educational videos and resources:

For younger people:

This interactive website that goes over the basics and talks about water use and ecology as well. Very kid friendly and interactive.

Aimed at older people:
This 11 minute video is targeted to an older audience, but has humor and a good pacing to be appealing to a younger audience as well.

TED-Ed lesson on Polarity. Aimed at high school or college aged audience, this one is a little more on the dry side, but has some nice learning questions in the “dig deeper” portion. http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-polarity-makes-water-behave-strangely-christina-kleinberg#digdeeper
