When I first met this person, her email address was JoyousNorth, and it struck me as very fitting. Not only because it was an excellent play on words in her actual name, but because this person is a sort of compass and guiding star to those around her.

If you're feeling overwhelmed and in need of a conversation with another adult? She's dropping by to take you to Starbucks for a drink and chat. If you're sick? She's there with a meal. Needing someone to laugh with, or a place to just be yourself? This is where you want to be.

Welcome to the table Joy!
