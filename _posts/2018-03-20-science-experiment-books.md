I've gathered a decent collection of science activity books in the last several years, and when someone at a recent conference asked for recommendations, I told them I'd put together a list for them. Here it is! 

## 365 Science Experiments by Glen Singleton. 
This one is definitely the book that my kids pick up and read the most. Perhaps because of the large size? The format is appealing with simple explanations and fun "Did you know?" boxes that accompany each experiment description.

## 101 Great Science Experiments by Neil Ardley.
If I were to be forced to pick one book to recommend (So hard! Don't make me do it!) then it might be this one. All my classic favorites are here, it has detailed instructions with full-color photos, and it covers a wide variety of subjects.

## Science Mom Guides
I almost left these off the list, because I wrote them. But honestly, I think they're fantastic activity books that have a lot to offer. So if you haven't checked them out, then you should! And if you write a review on Amazon I'll be forever grateful.

## The Everything Kids' Science Experiment Book by Tom Robinson.
While the above books have great instructions for science activities, they don't ask the reader questions or take that step from being an instruction manual to being a workbook. The Everything Kid's Science Experiment Book makes that step, having a "questions for the scientist" section after each lesson and offering follow up experiments. There are places to record observations and answer questions, but while the book adds significant thinking opportunities with its questions, it lacks pictures and has very few drawings. So I reference this one more than my kids do.

## Kitchen Science Lab for kids by Liz Lee Hienecke
52 fun experiments in this book on a wide variety of subjects. With photos, great little "science behind the fun" sections, great questions to encourage critical thinking and reasoning in the "creative enrichment" sections, this is a great book. If I were forced to pick one book to recommend (So hard! Don't make me do it!) It might be this one.

## Science Experiments You Can Eat by Vicki Cobb
A fun collection of edible experiments and an introducting into the chemistry of cooking all in one. From the carageenan stabilization in chocolate putdding to emulsions in salad dressings, these experiments will teach a lot. More in depth explanations than the previous books mentioned, but with clear instructions and explanations. No color photos and scant illustrations, so not quite as inviting as Kitchen Science or 101 Great Science Experiments, but still a great resource. And for the young scientist who really enjoys cooking? It's perfect.

## Pet Bugs and More Pet Bugs by Sally Kneidel
A fabulous set of books with detailed descriptions of a multitude of insects, where to find them, how to catch and keep them as pets. At first glance, you might think this book doesn't belong with science experiments, but observing insects is great scientific study and these guides are a wonderful introduction to entymology.

Alright, those seven books are my favorites, but that doesn't mean they need to be your favorites. There are several newer books on my "hope to buy sometime soon" list. Even when most of the experiments are ones I've seen before, I love looking through a well put together science experiment book. And now, a few quick notes about a few of the others in my collection:

## Theodor Gray's Completely Mad Science 
Experiments you should do at home but probably shouldn't. This truly isn't a how-to book, but a beautifully illustrated and fun tour of a fantastic series of experiments, almost all of which are definitely too dangerous (or expensive) to do at home. Great reading, but not a how-to book by any means.

## Rosie Revere's Big Project Book for Bold Engineers by Andrea Beaty
Geared for a younger scientist, perhaps age 5 to 8, this book is a fun compliation of simple engineering activities. There are pictures to be drawn, word puzzles to be solved, and more.

## STEAM KIDS
Put together by a group of bloggers, this compilation of 50 activities has fun pictures and a lot of art projects in addition to science activities.

## Science in Seconds for Kids by Jean Potter
A great reference that's easy to read.

## The Book of Totally Irresponsible Science by Sean Connolly
Written in a fun and sometimes sarcastic tone, the book has entertaining illustrations and side notes. If you have a kid who would be a good match for this sense of humor, this might be _just the book_ to hook them on science.

## The Book of Massively Epic Engineering Disasters by Sean Connolly
Ditto to the above note. Entertaining tone, great anecdotes and cartoon illustrations sprinkled throughout. A fun read and good projects.

I hope these books give you inspiration for launching your own science explorations. If you have a favorite that's not included here, let me know! I'm always looking to expand my own collection.
