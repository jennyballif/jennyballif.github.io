This card is for a patron who absolutely loves the Mojave Desert.

While I was drawing this landscape, the phrase "The desert, she has secrets" came to mind, and it wouldn't leave my mind. So I wrote a poem for Redondite:

## The desert, she has secrets

The desert, she has secrets for the quiet ear to hear,
A beauty stark and earnest, mysteries both far and near.

Come hither into this harsh land, prepared and willing to learn,
Leave distraction behind you, let go your modern concern.

Listen to rocks tell stories, of eras long dead and past,
The call of hawk and coyote, in a country both cramped and vast.

Time pauses for no man, but the desert? He waits for her.
Join Him in evening for sunset.
Sit, and watch the world turn.


Welcome to the table Redondite! I hope you enjoy many a beautiful moment in the desert this season, and always.
