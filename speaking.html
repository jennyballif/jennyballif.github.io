  <p>If you would like to schedule a Science Mom visit for your school or event, use the <a href="https://jennyballif.com/#contact">contact form</a> to learn more about availability. A school visit has a fee of $200 and books Science Mom from opening bell to closing bell, providing plenty of time for individual classroom visits and/or assemblies. Science Mom has dozens of developed presentations to choose from, many of which align with the Next Generation Science Standards.

  <p>Each month Science Mom donates books and science lessons to a school, thanks to the support of her wonderful patrons. If you're in the Las Vegas area and would like a chance at winning a free Science Mom visit for your school, <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/OpVj3aks7GMGI0Ot1" target=_blank>fill out this form</a>. A winner is drawn on the 1st of each month, and the school visit will be arranged for later in the month. If your school is not selected, you can enter the drawing again in subsequent months.</p>
